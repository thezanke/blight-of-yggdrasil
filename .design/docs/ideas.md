# Ideas

- Difficult mobs (e.g. Dark and Darker/Dark Souls)
- Full Loot PvP
- Persistent / Long-lived world with multiple player spawn-ins
- Lobby-based stash, hideout, vendors, etc
- No classes:
  - Single-item/weapon-only (wands? more options?):
    - Weapon affixes:
      - Add both offensive and defensive stats.
      - Add active abilities and passives? Or just a single move per weapon to keep it simple?
    - Find altars ('alters') throughout the world; they add affixes to weapon.
    - Weapons do not last forever. Magical weapons have charges/non-magical weapons have durability. Repairing is impossible or outrageously difficult or expensive or maybe it's a rare type of alter.
